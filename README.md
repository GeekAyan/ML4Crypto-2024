# ML4Crypto-2024

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning models and related scripts for the ML4Crypto 2024 challenge. The primary goal is to classify bitstreams generated by different random number generators based on specific patterns.

## Files

-  MLP.py: Implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron model for bitstream classification.
-  SVM.py: Uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify bitstreams.
-  classification.py: Contains a generic classification script that can be modified for various models.
-  dnn.py: A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model setup for more complex patterns in bitstreams.
-  evaluate_model.py: Script for evaluating model performance on test data.
-  log_reg.py: Implements Logistic Regression for bitstream classification.
-  Sample.csv / Sample.xlsx: Example datasets to help understand the structure of input data.
-  TrainingData.csv: Training data for the models.
-  trained_mlp_model.h5 / trained_nn_model.h5 / logistic_regression_model.pkl: Pre-trained models for quick evaluation and predictions.

## Usage
Each script can be run independently to train, evaluate, or predict with different models on bitstream data.
